Subdirectory Example
====================

Because Leia runs each test from the directory of the source markdown file you can package in other required testing assets.

Testing
-------

Run some tests using other stuff in this directory

```bash
# Analyze the contents of our first file
cat text1.txt | grep test

# Analze the contents of our second file
cat text2.txt | grep test2
```
